# Meeting Task Extraction and Assignment Tracker Using NLP

#### Aim:
Develop a natural language processing (NLP) solution to automatically extract and categorize assignee names and tasks assigned to them from a given set of unstructured text data. The system should be capable of accurately identifying different assignees and their associated tasks, even in cases where the language used is varied or complex. The final solution should provide a reliable method for extracting assignee-task pairs, enabling efficient task management and assignment tracking within the organization.
